
## Create DB schema

In order to create Apollo Location Service database schema:

1- If the schema has been updated, first re-write "scripts/create_schema.sh" by running "scripts/overwrite_create_schema_script.sh".

2- If db extensions has been changed recently, "scripts/create_extensions.sh" should be updated accordingly.

3- If a new spatial reference system has been added, update "scripts/update_spatial_ref_sys.sh" script.

4- Run "run.sh", which calls "scripts/create_extensions.sh", "scripts/create_schema.sh", and "scripts/update_spatial_ref_sys.sh", respectively.
